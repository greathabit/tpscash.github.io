We just had a fun team outing to Shuangxi this weekend. We enjoyed drifting on Saturday and it was a quite wonderful experience. 

There are kayaks and bamboo rafts in Shuangxi Rafting, while the former is exciting and is for two people and wooden paddles are used to drift you through the energetic waves, the latter is more relaxing. After rafting you can even take an ox cart among bamboo forests which is most certainly a different pace to raft.

Although the weather was quite hot (41 degree), but we really enjoyed the trip!
