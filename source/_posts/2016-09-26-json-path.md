A frequently emphasized advantage of XML is the availability of plenty tools to analyze, transform and selectively extract data out of XML documents. [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) is one of these powerful tools.

It's time to wonder, if there is a need for something like XPath4JSON and what are the problems it can solve.

* Data may be interactively found and extracted out of [JSON](http://json.org) structures on the client without special scripting.

* JSON data requested by the client can be reduced to the relevant parts on the server, such minimizing the bandwidth usage of the server response.

If we agree, that a tool for picking parts out of a JSON structure at hand does make sense, some questions come up. How should it do its job? How do JSONPath expressions look like?

## <a name="jsonpath"></a>JSONPath - XPath for JSON

Due to the fact, that JSON is a natural representation of data for the C family of programming languages, the chances are high, that the particular language has native syntax elements to access a JSON structure.

The following XPath expression

    /store/book[1]/title

would look like

    x.store.book[0].title

or

    x['store']['book'][0]['title']

In Javascript, Python and PHP with a variable x holding the JSON structure. Here we observe, that the particular language usually has a fundamental XPath feature already built in.

The JSONPath tool in question should …

* be naturally based on those language characteristics.

* cover only essential parts of XPath 1.0.

* be lightweight in code size and memory consumption.

* be runtime efficient.

## <a name="expression"></a>JSONPath Expressions

JSONPath expressions always refer to a JSON structure in the same way as XPath expression are used in combination with an XML document. Since a JSON structure is usually anonymous and doesn't necessarily have a "root member object" JSONPath assumes the abstract name $ assigned to the outer level object.

JSONPath expressions can use the dot–notation

    $.store.book[0].title

or the bracket–notation

    $['store']['book'][0]['title']

For input paths. Internal or output paths will always be converted to the more general bracket–notation.

JSONPath allows the wildcard symbol * for member names and array indices. It borrows the descendant operator '..' from [E4X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E4X) and the [array slice syntax](http://developer.mozilla.org/es4/proposals/slice_syntax.html) proposal [start:end:step] from [ECMASCRIPT 4](http://www.ecmascript.org/).

Expressions of the underlying scripting language (<expr>) can be used as an alternative to explicit names or indices as in

    $.store.book[(@.length-1)].title

Using the symbol '@' for the current object. Filter expressions are supported via the syntax ?(<boolean expr>) as in

    $.store.book[?(@.price < 10)].title
    
Here is a complete overview and a side by side comparison of the JSONPath syntax elements with its XPath counterparts.

| XPath | JSONPath | Description                                               |
|:-----:|:--------:|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| /     | $        | The root object/element                                   |
| .     | @        | The current object/element                                |
| /     | . or []  | Child operation                                           |
| ..    | n/a      | Parent operator                                           |
| //    | ..       | Recursive descent. JSONPath borrows this syntax from E4X. |
| *     | *        | Wildcard. All objects/elements regardless their names.    |
| @     | n/a      | Attribute access. JSON structures don't have attributes.  |
| []    | []       | Subscript operator. XPath uses it to iterate over element collections and for predicates. In Javascript and JSON it is the native array operator. |
| \|    | [,]      | Union operator in XPath results in a combination of node sets. JSONPath allows alternate names or array indices as a set. |
| n/a   | [start:end:step] | Array slice operator borrowed from ES4.           |
| []    | ?()      | Applies a filter (script) expression.                     |
| n/a   | ()       | Script expression, using the underlying script engine.    |
| ()    | n/a      | Grouping in Xpath                                         |

XPath has a lot more to offer (Location paths in not abbreviated syntax, operators and functions) than listed here. Moreover there is a remarkable difference how the subscript operator works in XPath and JSONPath.

* Square brackets in XPath expressions always operate on the node set resulting from the previous path fragment. Indices always start by 1.

* With JSONPath square brackets operate on the object or array addressed by the previous path fragment. Indices always start by 0.

## <a name="examples"></a>JSON Examples

Let's practice JSONPath expressions by some more examples. We start with a simple JSON structure built after an XML example representing a bookstore (original [XML file](http://coli.lili.uni-bielefeld.de/~andreas/Seminare/sommer02/books.xml)).

            "title": "Sayings of the Century",
            "price": 8.95
          },
          { "category": "fiction",

## <a name="javaimpl"></a>JSONPath Java Implementation

Please find it in [GitHub](https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath)
    
## <a name="otherimpl"></a>JSONPath JS/PHP Implementation

JSONPath is implemented in Javascript for client side usage and ported over to PHP for use on the server.

### Usage

All you need to do is downloading either of the files

* [jsonpath.js](http://code.google.com/p/jsonpath/)
* [jsonpath.php](http://code.google.com/p/jsonpath/)

Include it in your program and use the simple API consisting of one single function.

jsonPath(obj, expr [, args])

### Parameters:

* obj (object\|array):

    Object representing the JSON structure.
    
* expr (string):

    JSONPath expression string.
    
* args (object\|undefined):

    Object controlling path evaluation and output. Currently only one member is supported.
    
* args.resultType ("VALUE"\|"PATH"):

    Causes the result to be either matching values (default) or normalized path expressions.
    
### Return value

* (array\|false):

    Array holding either values or normalized path expressions matching the input path expression, which can be used for lazy evaluation. false in case of no match.
    
### Javascript Example

    var o = { /*...*/ },  // the 'store' JSON object from above
    res1 = jsonPath(o, "$..author").toJSONString(),
    res2 = jsonPath(o, "$..author", {resultType:"PATH"}).toJSONString
    
### PHP Example

We need here to convert the JSON string to a PHP array first. I am using Michal Migurski's JSON parser for that.

    require_once('json.php');      // JSON parser
    require_once('jsonpath.php');  // JSONPath evaluator
    
    $json = '{ ... }';  // JSON structure from above
    
    $parser = new Services_JSON(SERVICES_JSON_LOOSE_TYPE);
    $o = $parser->decode($json);
    $match1 = jsonPath($o, "$..author");
    $match2 = jsonPath($o, "$..author", array("resultType" => "PATH"));
    $res1 = $parser->encode($match1);
    $res2 = $parser->encode($match2);
    
### Results

Both Javascript and PHP example result in the following JSON arrays (as strings):

    res1:
    [ "Nigel Rees",
      "Evelyn Waugh",
      "Herman Melville",
      "J. R. R. Tolkien"
    ]
    res2:
    [ "$['store']['book'][0]['author']",
      "$['store']['book'][1]['author']",
      "$['store']['book'][2]['author']",
      "$['store']['book'][3]['author']"
    ]
    
Please note, that the return value of jsonPath is an array, which is also a valid JSON structure. So you might want to apply jsonPath to the resulting structure again or use one of your favorite array methods as sort with it.

## <a name="issues"></a>Issues

* Currently only single quotes allowed inside of JSONPath expressions.

* Script expressions inside of JSONPath locations are currently not recursively evaluated by jsonPath. Only the global $ and local @ symbols are expanded by a simple regular expression. 

* An alternative for jsonPath to return false in case of no match may be to return an empty array in future.
