For safety purpose, you can create a user without login for SSH tunneling.

Such user won't have access to login the system and don't have a home folder either. The only thing this user can do is changing the login password.

Commands to create a restricted user for SSH tunneling:

    #Create user
    useradd -M -s /sbin/nologin -n username
    
    #Modify password
    passwd username
    
    #Remove the user
    userdel -r username
